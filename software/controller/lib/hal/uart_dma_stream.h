// Maintains a double buffer that is assigned to DMA for transmission over UART.
// One buffer is read by DMA and the other is written by software.
// DMA transmission will be triggered and buffers exchanged when:
// * buffer is full or
// * EndOfStream is received
// Transmissions are scheduled to re-trigger if there is an ongoing DMA
// transmission. That is done by interrupt from UartDma driver.
//
// Returns flags:
// * ErrorStreamBroken if DMA error interrupt detected
// * ErrorBufferFull if an attempt was made to write to stream while all
//   buffers were full
// * WarningBufferFull if the buffer became full after the last char written
// * StreamSuccess if there is space available in buffers after the char is
// written
