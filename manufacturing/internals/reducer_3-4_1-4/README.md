# Oxygen tubing reducer

## Design rationale

The first few components on the oxygen line will use 1/4"ID tubing, before transitioning to the 3/4"ID tubing used
throughout the rest of the ventilator assembly. Unfortunately, there is no readily available off-the-shelf reducer for
interfacing these diameters. For this purpose, we have created a custom 3d-printable adapter.

In a future iteration, the reducer may be integrated right into the venturi that follows.
