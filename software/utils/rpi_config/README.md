# Deployment on integrated prototypes

The following scripts and configurations are here to help alleviate the frustration of having to perform the many arcane incantations to get a prototype running with software.

**DISCLAIMER: You should not use this on any living beings - as a ventilator, or in any other way. These are utilities for bench testing with mechanical lung simulators only. It is also assumed that you are familiar with the software architecture and generally know what you are doing.**

The following assumes that you have a working hardware prototype with all necessary electronics, correctly wired for power and communication. See the [manufacturing](../../../manufacturing) section for details.

## Initial OS setup

The first few configuration steps must be done manually when writing the operating system to the SD card.

* Use an SD card of at least 32GB. Building the software can be a resource-greedy process.
* Flash the SD card using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) making sure to configure it as follows:
  * **IMPORTANT:** Click 'CHOOSE OS' > 'Raspberry Pi OS (Other)' and select the `Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)` release of the Raspberry Pi OS. Other versions have not been tested to work. More specifically should be the `v11 Bullseye 64 bits (January 28th 2022)` release ([download link](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2022-01-28/)).
  * Click 'STORAGE' and select your SD card
  * Click the gear icon in the lower right corner, and set up the following parameters:
   * hostname (recommended): `rw-ventilator` - could make it something else unique if you have multiple prototypes on your network
   * username (mandatory): `admin` - system should boot to this user by default, otherwise desktop shortcuts may not work
   * password (recommended): `respira` - will need this for `sudo` tasks, so don't forget it
   * enable *ssh* and set up credentials to access the machine remotely, especially if you cannot attach a keyboard to your prototype
   * configure wifi SSID and password settings if needed
   * set time zone and disable `first run wizard` (note this feature seems to be missing on some versions of Imager, the instructions below will account for this)
   * Click 'SAVE'
   * Click 'WRITE'
   * Important: you must wait until you get the message from the RPi Imager that you can remove the SD card before doing so. (There is an extra process that runs after it gets to 100% - if you eject or remove the card too early, the configuration information won't be written successfully).
* Once the card is written, remove it and plug it into the RPi, then power it on.
* If your Rpi Imager software did not have an option to disable the first run wizard, and you have a screen attached, the RPi configurator will run on the first boot, and ask you to re-set a lot of the configuration you already entered in the Imager.  You can click 'CANCEL' and close this window without going through any of the settings.
* Once it is booted, you should be able to *ssh* into the RasPi from another machine by running `ssh admin@rw-ventilator` (or whatever host name you gave it). Otherwise, you can find out*RPi*'s IP address with `ifconfig` and then you can reach it as `ssh admin@IP_ADDRESS`. If you had logged into another instance with the same hostname, you may need to clear the old credentials with `ssh-keygen -R rw-ventilator.local`.

## Automatic setup

With the above configured, the next step should be pretty automatic. You can still use a stand-alone RasPi without all the hardware.

Whether by `ssh` or attached keyboard, copy and paste this command into a terminal:

<!-- \TODO: change command to point to master before merging!!! -->
```shell
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RespiraWorks/Ventilator/master/software/utils/rpi_config/bootstrap.sh)
```

Follow the onscreen directions. When the initial installation is complete, the system will reboot.

This is a good time to:
* transfer the SD card to the target machine
* make sure you have a USB connection from the PI to the Nucleo so that it can update controller firmware
* if you have `ssh` access, the rest should work without the need for keyboard and mouse attached to the PI

### Final configuration and initial software deployment

When the machine boots, you should see an icon that says `Ventilator update` on the desktop. Either double-click or use the touch screen to run this shortcut.
This will build the graphical interface and controller software, and deploy the latter to the STM32.

**NOTE:** You may also want to check that audio is set to be piped to `HDMI` rather than the `AV Jack` by right clicking on the volume icon in the task bar.

## What you have available

On your desktop you should have:
* Ventilator GUI -- starts the graphical interface for controlling the ventilator
* Github repo -- opens a browser to the RespiraWorks ventilator github page, in case you need to consult documentation
* Ventilator update -- run this any time to update all firmware and software to the latest version
* debug -- opens console with ventilator debug interface and connects to the controller. You should be able to use this utility via `ssh` as well, by running `~/ventilator/software/controller/controller.sh debug`.
* For your convenience, a virtual `matchbox-keyboard` utility has been installed, which can be found on the main application menu under `Accessories`.
