risks:
    - hazard: Incorrect information
      software_item: Annotation Metric Calculator
      events: |
          - A software defect in the Annotation Metric Calculator causes the
            size an annotated tumor to be significantly under-estimated
          - The radiologist fails to notice the discrepancy
      hazardous_situation: The oncologist is presented with incorrect tumor sizes
      harm: An inappropriate therapy is given to the patient
      severity: Catastrophic
      probability: Low
      control_measures: null
      residual_severity: null
      residual_probability: null
      notes: Although it is not possible to estimate the probability of the
          software defect occurring, it is unlikely that the radiologist would not
          noticed the discrepancy.
