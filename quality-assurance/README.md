# Quality Assurance

As life support equipment, ventilators must have a high-quality design,
with design controls, thorough review, and a well documented
verification plan. Our design is developed under an ISO 14971 process,
and our software under ISO 62304. We will qualify the device under ISO
60601-1 once the design has reached a sufficient level of maturity. All
of these process and design controls are critical to the successful
design of a product that will be responsible for a human life.
Conforming with existing quality standards facilitates the regulatory
approval process for our initial deployment.

### Characterization Testing

For details on component characterization tests, see the [Characterization Test Plan](characterization-test-plan.md).

## Testing

Documentation relating to the testing equipment, strategy and test data is in the [testing](testing) subdirectory.
