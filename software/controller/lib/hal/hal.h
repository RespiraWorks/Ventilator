// A hardware abstraction layer that supports faking for tests.
//
// The canonical list of hardware and the pins they connect to is:
// https://bit.ly/3aERr69
//
// When running in test mode, HalApi is pedantically a fake, not a mock.  All
// that means is that the methods have "fake" implementations, trying to
// loosely mimic the hardware in some defined way.  For example, instead of
// telling the actual amount of time since boot, Now() stays constant, and
// doesn't advance unless you call Delay().
//
// It would be possible to mock some methods in HAL if we needed to.  A mock is
// a method whose behavior can be controlled by the test itself; it might do
// nothing, or it might throw an exception, or whatever.  Tests can also
// observe whether mocked methods are called.  So far that hasn't been
// necessary.
