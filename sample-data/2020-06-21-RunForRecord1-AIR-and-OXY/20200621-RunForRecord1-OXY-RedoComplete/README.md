# 2020-06-21 Performance Evaluation Run for Record 1 - OXYGEN

- Test Hardware: SN 01 (Edwin)
- PID Gains: kp = 0.04 ki = 20.0
- Exhale Valve Settings: exhale = 1.0f - 0.6f * psol_valve - 0.4f
- Pinch Valve Linearization: unchanged
- Test #8 calls for R10 but this is not a QuickLung setting, so R20 was used.
- Notes: This dataset includes CoVent AD Instruments data, setup photos.  This is a complete redo of the oxygen test set because the first run was done with the QuickLung settings incorrect for test #4

Run for record using compressed air (stand-in for pure oxygen) only.
