You will need to give yourself video and audio permissions by adding yourself to those groups.

Tried playing with `motion` first. The conf file is included which should go into ~/.motion/
But it appears motion will not support sound, which I think we may want to have at some point.

Next up is ffmpeg.

Gets sound:
ffmpeg -f alsa -ac 1 -ar 16000 -i hw:1,0 -t 10 out.wav

To figure out parameter for hw:
arecord -l or arecord -L will list devices
TODO: survive reboot, i.e. hw device number may change. Must freeze it somehow?

Gets video:
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -framerate 15 -i /dev/video0 output3.mkv
but will not play in VLC. Wrong codec? Can we get it to convert?

This gets us video and sound together:
ffmpeg \
-f v4l2 -framerate 15 -i /dev/video0 \
-f alsa -ac 1 -ar 16000 -i hw:1,0 \
-t 10 output3.mkv

To stream:
ffmpeg \
-f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 \
-f alsa -ac 1 -ar 16000 -i hw:1,0 \
-vcodec libx264 -tune zerolatency -f mpegts udp://192.168.1.8:8081

Receive like this:
ffplay udp://192.168.1.12:8081

But this assumes direct streaming frrom 1.12 to 1.8 on LAN. How do we broadcast?
