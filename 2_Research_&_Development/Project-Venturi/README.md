# Venturi Flow Sensor

![Rendering](assets/screenshot.png)

The venturi is used to measure flow by measuring a change in pressure as the flow accelerates through the throat. The change in pressure is measured between the two ports, and this is correlated to the flow rate through the device. This version inserts within 5/8" ID tubing, though can also be used with 16mm ID tubing. You can use a zip tie or hose clamp to improve the seal. 

The plan is for [beta](/../../4_Manufacturing_Design/Beta_Build_Instructions/README.md) to use 3/4"ID tubing throughout.
The venturi will most likely be redesigned to have barbs that fit 3/4"ID tubing directly.

The pressure sensor we are using has 2.5 mm or 3/32" barbs, which is too small for 1/8" tubing, therefore this model has #10-32 tapped holes.

There is an arrow printed onto the body to indicate the direction of flow.

## Transfer Function

To go from voltage to flow rate, you need the following transfer functions.
For a 0.157" throat and 0.5" body using a 0-3920 Pa analog sensor, where offset is the 0 flow signal:

Q [liters/minute] = 0.75398*sqrt(1346.584669*(voltage-offset))

**#TODO:** make math pretty with Mathjax?

For an arbitrary body geometry, you can use [this short spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9Kb-ImlluK8MOx-ce2rlHUBnTOtAFQvKjjs1bEhlpM/edit#gid=963553579) to return the transfer function.

## Pressure Sensor

This venturi is designed to be paired with this sensor and a 14-bit ADC.

Adjust values in the spreadsheet above accordingly to see how it will perform in your setup.

### Guidelines

These should not be printed with FDM. Instead, a leaktight method like SLA or MJF should be used. Also, this model contains printed threads and is designed to interface with the referenced mcmaster barbed fitting (item 2 below). 

Note that the flow measurement is very sensitive to the exact geometry, particularly the thread geometry. 3D printing can have variable shrinkage that results in uncertainty in the throat size, and thus the flow rates. Check the diameter of the printed venturi; a good way to do this is to put a drill into the venturi that just barely fits, and then measure the diameter of that drill bit. (Any round thing will work.)

## Assembly

![Nipples](assets/venturi-nipples.jpg)

Screw the nipples into the 3d-printed venturi.
There are threads in the print but they donâ€™t always come out right if resin gets trapped in the grooves while it prints.
In such a case you might need a tap (listed in tooling BOM above) to clean the threads. You do not need a bottoming tap, since there is enough depth in the holes and the threads are short.

In the latest tested version, no hand-tapping was required to insert nipples. With good enough 3d printing, this step should not be necessary. 

**#TODO:** instructions on connecting tubes to sensors

## Testing

Check for leaks by plugging the holes and pulling some vacuum. 

* Plug one large end, plug both nipples, suck on the remaining end.  If you have a vacuum pump handy do a regular vacuum hold leak test.
* Or, blow into each port with your fingers over the other three.
