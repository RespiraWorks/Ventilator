# Blower Bypass

The blower bypass is an optional "topping" that can be integrated into the [pizza build](../Alpha_Build_Instructions/pizza_build.md).

The purpose of the blower bypass is to prevent strain on blower when the inhale pinch valve is closed. This is the version for 3/8"ID [alpha build](../Alpha_Build_Instructions).
