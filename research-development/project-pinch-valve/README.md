## Overview

This contains details, BOM, & instructions for one pinch valve assembly for the pneumatic circuit. 

The module is something that can be "spliced" into any location in the pneumatic circuit.
This makes it interchangeable with solenoid or whatever other valve implementation we might consider/test.

For a full prototype build you will need 2 pinch valves, in which case it makes sense to purchase a 2-axis stepper driver,
though you can work with two single-stepper drivers if that's what you already have. 

### Change history

The stop is moved down by 3 mm, which should buy us a lot more leverage.
The stop is now flat. We might need to tweak exact dimensions further to get a perfect close, but this should be better.
Watching the video I'm pretty concerned watching that stop flex. I made it run the full width, I made it thicker, and I also bulked out the tube holders.
Bearings are now better aligned with the tube.

v1.6: Broader shelf, slightly larger bump.

v1.7: set screw removed, 3/8"OD version added for potential use as oxygen supply valve.

## 3D Printing

### Guidelines

These files should not be printed with FDM. Instead, a leak-tight method like SLA or MJF should be used.

You may also find other variations of the design meant for special testing/calibration units.

## Assembly Instructions

![Components](assets/components.jpg)

Youâ€™ll need a vice to press on the rotors to the stepper motor shafts.  You may also need a tap ([Item a3](#tools)) to
chase the threads in the rotor ([Item 10](#parts)) for the bolt ([Item 2](#parts)) holding the bearings. On some
machines they way print too tight and you may crack the rotor trying to just muscle in the bolt without chasing the
threads first.  Prop tip: only chase a portion of the threads for the bolt that holds on the bearings, leaving a bit
to act as a lock nut.

Rotor Assembly                     |  Base Assembly           |   
:---------------------------------:|:-------------------------: 
![Assembled](assets/rotor.jpg)|  ![Assembled](assets/assembled.jpg)  
3mm hex and 2.5mm hex driver are required for assembling rotor.|  2mm hex driver is required for attaching base.

Assembled it should look something like this, ready to be integrated:
