# Pizza Build: Test Lung Sub-Assembly

True test lungs are expensive and hard to come by, so we must do with what's available. 

This page explains how to adapt off-the-shelf parts into a basic test lung for our ventilator prototype.

Note: You can optionally add-on to this simple test lung to make a reduced-compliance test lung; [instructions for that are here](../pizza-compliance-test-lung).

## Assembly

The test lung (*item 1*) will arrive with elbow fitting, tee-connector and CPAP hoses.

These hoses are not great for interfacing with our system, so you should replace them with the set bought separately (*item 3*).

The rubber ends work well with 3/4"ID fittings and can be clamped to seal air tight.
