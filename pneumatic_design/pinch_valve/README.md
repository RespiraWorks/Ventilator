#Stepper proportional pinch valve

**TODO:** add rendering

Here's a new version with a few fixes:
the stop is moved down by 3 mm, which should buy us a lot more leverage
the stop is now flat. We might need to tweak exact dimensions further to get a perfect close, but this should be better
watching the video I'm pretty concerned watching that stop flex. I made it run the full width, I made it thicker, and I also bulked out the tube holders
bearings are now better aligned with the tube

**TODO:** link and explain STL files
