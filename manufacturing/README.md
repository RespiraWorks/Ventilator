# Part Purchasing Guidelines

If you are a member of the RespiraWorks team, please don’t buy anything using personal funds (we need to document everything in specific ways to meet the requirements of our grant funding).

Before purchasing any parts, **ask** team members (the [#dev-hardware](https://respiraworks.slack.com/archives/C012UTERXD5) RespiraWorks Slack channel is a good place to start) if they have any spare parts floating around. There are a lot of extras, so you may be able to get your hands on parts without ordering anything.

If you do need to purchase parts, follow the process below. Note: This process is subject to change as we work out any issues. Message Curtis Kline with any questions.

1. If you need to buy something, put the details into a post in [#purchasing-sourcing](https://respiraworks.slack.com/archives/C011FD2TEQM) (RespiraWorks Slack channel) and tag the [@purchasing group](https://respiraworks.slack.com/admin/user_groups).
2. One of the Purchasing team members will source the items and confirm with you before placing the order (unless it’s obvious).
3. Everything will be purchased using a RespiraWorks credit card whenever possible.
4. The Purchasing team member will reply to your message in [#purchasing-sourcing](https://respiraworks.slack.com/archives/C011FD2TEQM) with tracking info when available.
5. in the rare case that you do buy something urgent with your own payment methods, submit your receipts to #accounting-reimburse.
