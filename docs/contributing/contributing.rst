Contributing
============

One of our core tenets is easy accessibility to all and open sharing of our knowledge. As such, we are an open-source project. We believe this approach best aligns with our desire to make our equipment accessible to all. Our team has contributed new, original designs for low-cost ventilator components that have been adopted by other ventilator projects around the world.

CLA
---
Contributors are asked to sign Contributor License Agreement (CLA) when submitting their first Pull Request (PR).

Requiring a CLA is a common and well-accepted practice in open source. Major open source projects require CLAs such as Apache Software Foundation projects, Python, Django, and more. Each of these projects remains licensed under permissive OSS licenses.

Agreeing to a CLA explicitly states that you are entitled to provide a contribution, and that you cannot withdraw permission to use your contribution at a later date. At the same time, the CLA ensures that all of your contributions will remain available under the original license under which you contributed.

Agreeing to the CLA is not a transfer of ownership. You do not lose or change any of your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.
