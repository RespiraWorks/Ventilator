# Oxygen mixing chamber

## Design rationale

The need for an oxygen mixing solution has been identified in tickets
[#659](https://github.com/RespiraWorks/Ventilator/issues/659) and
[#780](https://github.com/RespiraWorks/Ventilator/issues/780).

The mixing chamber should passively produce a well blended stream of oxygen and ambient air. Research has not been
carried out on the best solution for this. It may very well be that a simple T- or Y-connector is sufficient for the
purpose.

Further refinements to this solution are tracked in [#915](https://github.com/RespiraWorks/Ventilator/issues/915).

## Implementation

The following simple Y-connector with barbs for 3/4"ID tubing has been designed.
