# Custom tubing adapters

## Design rationale

The need for additional custom tubing adapters was identified during work on the v0.3 prototype:
[Issue #1019](https://github.com/RespiraWorks/Ventilator/issues/1019).

Two of these have been implemented, but more may yet be needed, depending on evolving pneumatics configuration.

## Implementation

A parametrized part was designed with 2 configurations: 60 and 90 degrees respectively.

|        60°         |        90°         |
