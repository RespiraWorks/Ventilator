revision: 1
title: Software Plan
—</p>
<p># Purpose</p>
<p>This document describes a set of activities which will be used during software risk management, development, and maintenance of {{ system.project_name }}.  It is written primarily for software developers.</p>
<p>{{ system.project_name }} is assigned a Class {{ system.safety_class }} software safety class, which means {% if system.safety_class == “A” %}no injury or damage to health{% elif system.safety_class == “B” %}non-serious injury{% else %}death or serious injury{% endif %} could occur if the software fails [[62304:4.3.a]].  See {{ system.risk_matrix_location }} for details. All of the software items that compose the software system are also presumed to have the same Class {{ system.safety_class }} safety class [[62304:4.3.c 62304:4.3.d 62304:4.3.d 62304:4.3.e 62304:4.3.f 62304:4.3.g]].  The primary purpose of this document is to help developers ensure {{ system.project_name }} is safe and useful while also allowing developers to be productive.  The secondary purpose is to comply with {{ system.standard }}.</p>
<p>[[:In order to assist auditors and regulators, we have included section references to {{ system.standard }} as well as occasional comments throughout this document.  These references and comments are always placed inside square brackets, and they are not present in the software-developer version of the document.  Other than these comments, the software-developer version is identical to the auditor version of this document.]]</p>
<p>[[FDA-CPSSCMD:dev-environment]]</p>
<p># Overview</p>
<p>## Definitions</p>
<p>[[:Most of these definitions are very similar to the {{ system.standard }} definitions, however, they have been modified as appropriate for a better understanding by software developers.]]</p>
<p>{# TODO: update our first-pass rdm extension so that we can only include
phrases that occur in this document #}</p>
<p>{% for word, definition in definitions.items()|sort %}
<strong>{{ word }}</strong> {{ definition }}
{% endfor %}</p>
<p>## Development Life Cycle Model</p>
<p>{{ system.project_name }} will be developed using an agile software development life cycle model.  The agile strategy develops the software system using a sequence of builds.  Customer needs and software system requirements are partially defined up front, then are refined in each succeeding build [[62304:5.1.1; by “agile” we mean a combined evolutionary and incremental life cycle model]].</p>
<p>## Roles and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The activities described in this document are designed for a team composed of a project lead and one to eight software developers.  One of the software developers shall be assigned the role of the project lead.  The project lead, working on behalf of the manufacturer, is responsible for the safety and utility of the software system built by the team.</p>
<p>{# TODO: briefly discussion conviction that software developers are in the best position to perform risk analysis and documentation during development #}</p>
<p>At least one team member must be trained in risk management [[14971:4.3]].</p>
<p>## Related Documents</p>
<p>[[:This section fulfills 62304:5.1.8.a, 62304:5.1.8.b, and 62304:5.1.8.c]]</p>
<p>The <strong>level of concern</strong> document is written by the project lead, in conjunction with the manufacturer, up front.  Its purpose is to help guide the risk analysis and inform the FDA.  It may be updated as part of [risk assessment activity](#risk-assessment).  It is reviewed by the project lead during the [release activity](#release).</p>
<p>The <strong>software description</strong> is not a separate document, but is included within the SDS.</p>
<p>The <strong>software requirements specification</strong> (or <strong>SRS</strong>) describes what the software needs to accomplish. It is largely written by the project lead during the [requirements analysis activity](#requirements-analysis), and is reviewed by the project lead during the [release activity](#release). Software developers may clarify and extend the document slightly during the [unit implementation and testing activity](#unit-implementation-and-testing).</p>
<p>The <strong>software architecture chart</strong> is not a separate document, but is included within the SDS.</p>
<p>The <strong>software design specification</strong> (or <strong>SDS</strong>) describes how the software accomplishes what the SRS requires.  A significant portion is written by the project lead during the [architectural design activity](#architectual-design), but many details and specifics are added by software developers during the [unit implementation and testing activity](#unit-implementation-and-testing).  It is reviewed for consistency by the project lead during the [release activity](#release).</p>
<p>A <strong>release history</strong> includes a list of change requests and problem reports addressed within a release.  It also includes a record of the implemented changes and their verification and a list of known anomalies.  The content of the document is slowly built up by software developers during the [unit implementation and testing activity](#unit-implementation-and-testing).  It is reviewed by the project lead during the [release activity](#release).</p>
<p>A <strong>test record</strong> describes a set of tests which were run, when, and by who.  It also must include enough details to reproduce the testing setup.</p>
<p>A <strong>release record</strong> describes the verifications steps performed by the project lead during the [release activity](#release).</p>
<p>## Development Standards</p>
<p>TODO: The project lead should keep an up-to-date list of development standards here (e.g., PEP8 on a Python project).</p>
<p>If the software system’s safety classification is not level C (the highest), you may delete this section.</p>
<p>[[:This section fulfills 62304:5.1.4.a]]</p>
<p>## Development Methods</p>
<p>[[62304:5.1.4.b]]</p>
<p>TODO: The project lead should keep an up-to-date list of development methods here (e.g., Test Driven Development) if relevant.</p>
<p>If the software system’s safety classification is not level C (the highest), you may delete this section.</p>
<p>## Development Tools</p>
<p>[[62304:5.1.4.c]]</p>
<p>TODO: The project lead should keep an up-to-date list of development tools here, such as linters and versions.</p>
<p>If the software system’s safety classification is not level C (the highest), you may delete this section.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, checking against these standards should be performed in an automated fashion (e.g., using a linter which is run on a Git-commit hook) [[62304:5.1.4]].</p>
<p>## Testing Plan</p>
<p>[[62304:5.5.2]]</p>
<p>All final tests must include the Git hash or other objective reference that can be used to identify the exact software tested [[62304:5.1.11]].</p>
<p>TODO: Write out a testing plan for {{ system.project_name }}.</p>
<p>This plan should include a pass/fail criteria for the entire test suite.  E.g., you require that all unit tests pass and that all integration tests pass or the cause of the failure is understood and justified [[62304:5.7.1.a]]</p>
<p>## Quality Assurance</p>
<p>The activities below are designed to meet ISO 13506 quality control standard [[62304:4.1]].</p>
<p>## Risk Management</p>
<p>The Risk Assessment, Risk Control and other activities below are intended to meet ISO 14971 risk management standard [[62304:4.2 14971:3.1 14971:3.2]].</p>
<p># Activities</p>
<p>This section of the software plan describes the various activities involved with software development, maintenance, risk management, problem resolution, and version control (also known, in regulatory lingo as “configuration management”).  The relationship between the inputs and outputs of these activities are displayed in the following diagram and are fully described in the sub-sections below.  Since we are using an agile development life cycle, activities may be performed before their inputs have settled and thus inputs and outputs may not be consistent between releases. [[Note that tasks are presented within each activity, although we do not explicitly demarcate them.]]</p>
<p>[[:This software plan does not explicitly separate the software development process, software maintenance process, configuration management process, problem resolution process, and software-related risk management because we are using an agile software development life cycle and thus the processes overlap with one another significantly.  The activities described here fulfill 62304:4.2 62304:5.1.1.a, 62304:5.1.1.b, 62304:5.1.6, 62304:5.1.7, and 62304:5.1.9.b as well as, software-related portions 14971:3.4.a, 14971:3.4.b, 14971:3.4.c, 14971:3.4.e, and 14971:3.5]]</p>
<p>## Activity Diagram</p>
<p>![Overview of life-cycle processes](../images/lifecycle-processes.svg)</p>
<p>## Planning</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> User needs, system requirements, and risk controls</p>
<p>Setup a Git repository on GitHub. All software activity outputs will be stored in this Git repository, the associated GitHub issues, or the associated GitHub pull requests, unless explicitly noted otherwise [[62304:5.1.1.b]]. Problem reports and change requests are stored as GitHub issues. A GitHub issue tagged with the <cite>bug</cite> label is a problem report. If a problem report outlines a set of requested changes, then it can simultaneously act as a change request. GitHub issues tagged with the <cite>obsolete</cite> label are ignored.</p>
<p>The software developers working on the project are responsible for keeping all software activity outputs within version control at the times specified in the activity descriptions [[62304:5.1.9.c, 62304:5.1.9.d, and 62304:5.1.9.e]].</p>
<p>[[:Note that we do not explicitly use the term “software configuration management” since many developers will be unfamiliar with the term, and instead we use the term “version control.”  Git is a version control system that makes it simple to track and record the history of every file it contains in a precise and controller manner. The requirements listed in sections 62304:5.1.9.a, 62304:5.1.11, 62304:8.1.1, 62304:8.1.3, 62304:8.3, and 62304:9.5 are fulfilled by our use of Git and GitHub.  Also note that this setup implies that all activity outputs that are stored in the Git repository, GitHub issues, or GitHub pull requests are configuration items.  Furthermore, the version of every configuration item comprising the software system configuration is stored in the Git repository for the entire history of the project.  Each activity describes the configuration items in more detail.]]</p>
<p>In the Software Design Specification, record details about the project’s build process, including tool versions, environment variables, etc. [[62304:5.1.10 and 62304:5.8.5]].  Also document how the software can be reliably delivered to the point of use without corruption or unauthorized change [[62304:5.8.8]].</p>
<p>Search through this document, and the other documents in this set of templates, for the text “TODO”. Follow the instructions next to the “TODO” sections. Once you are done you may delete the instructions. Note that longer instructions may be demarcated with “ENDTODO”.</p>
<p>Keep this planning document up to date as the project commences [[62304:5.1.2]].</p>
<p>In conjunction with the manufacturer’s management, review and update as appropriate the:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>qualitative risk severity categories</p></li>
<li><p>qualitative risk probability categories</p></li>
<li><p>qualitative risk levels</p></li>
</ul>
<p>contained within {{ system.risk_matrix_location }} [[14971:3.4.d, 14971:D.3, 14971:D.4, 14971:D.8]].</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> The markdown version of this plan document and the Git repository hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>
<p>Review the document for typos our outdated information.</p>
<p>Ensure that activity in the software plan specifies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the activity inputs</p></li>
<li><p>the activity outputs</p></li>
<li><p>output verification steps, if any</p></li>
<li><p>which role should perform and verify the activity [[62304:5.1.6.a and 62304:5.1.6.b]].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>## Requirements Analysis</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> User needs, system requirements, and risk controls</p>
<p>{% if not system.is_software_only_device %}
Record system requirements in {{ system.system_requirements_location }}.  Each system requirement must have a unique identifier so that we can trace software requirements back to the system requirements they fulfill [[62304:5.1.3.a 62304:5.1.3.b]].
{% endif %}</p>
<p>Important software requirements should be enumerated at the start of the project [[62304:5.2.1]].{% if not system.is_software_only_device %} Software requirements must be tied to one or more originating system requirements via the system requirement’s ids [[62304:5.1.1.c]].  If a software requirement can not be tied back to any system requirements, new system requirements should be added.{% endif %}</p>
<p>When software requirements are added or changed, re-evaluate the medical device risk analysis [[62304:5.2.4]] and ensure that existing software requirements{% if not system.is_software_only_device %}, and system requirements,{% endif %} are re-evaluated and updated as appropriate [[62304:5.2.5]].</p>
<p>See [the appendices](#requirements-analysis) for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Software requirements, Git</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> Ensure software requirements:
{% if not system.is_software_only_device %}
- implement system requirements and are labeled with system requirement ids [[62304:5.2.6.a 62304:5.2.6.f]]
- implement risk controls
{%- endif %}
- don’t contradict each other [[62304:5.2.6.b]]
- have unambiguous descriptions [[62304:5.2.6.c]]
- are stated in terms that permit establishment of test criteria and performance of tests to determine whether the test criteria have been met [[62304:5.2.6.d]].</p>
<p>{% if system.safety_class != ‘A’ %}</p>
<p>## Architectural Design</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Software requirements</p>
<p>Develop an initial software system architecture and document it in the SDS [[62304:5.3.1]].  The SDS should describe how the software system is divided into a hierarchy of software items [[62304:5.4.1]].  Software units are often thought of as being a single function or module, but this is not always appropriate.</p>
<p>Show the software and hardware interfaces between the software items and external software [[62304:5.3.2]].  Prefer block diagrams and flow charts to textual descriptions, and include these diagrams in the SDS.  Indicate which software items are SOUP.</p>
<p>{% if system.safety_class == ‘C’ %}
Identify any segregation between software items that is essential to risk control, and state how to ensure that the segregation is effective.  For example, one may segregate software items by running them on different processors [[62304:5.3.5]].
{% endif %}
The initial architecture does not need to be complete, since code construction can guide architectural decisions. However, it is worth spending a significant amount of time on the initial architecture.  Once development commences (i.e., the [unit implementation and testing activity](#unit-implementation-and-testing)), update the SDS as the architecture is refined.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> SDS</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> Ensure software architecture documented in the SDS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>implements system and software requirements [[62304:5.3.6.a]].</p></li>
<li><p>is able to support interfaces between software items and between software items and hardware [[62304:5.3.6.b]].</p></li>
<li><p>is such that the medical device architecture supports proper operation of any SOUP items [[62304:5.3.6.c]].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>{% endif %}</p>
<p>## Risk Assessment</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>[[:This activity is meant to fulfill sections 14971:4.1.a, 14971:4.1.b, 14971:4.1.c, 14971:4.2</dt><dd><p>14971:5, 14971:6.1, and 14971:6.2 of 14971 with respect to software related risks]]</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Software design specification</p>
<p>Begin by identifying known and forseeably hazards associated with{% if system.is_software_only_device %} how the software is intended to be used within medical practice{% else %} the device{% endif %} [[14971:4.3]].  It is frequently necessary to consult with a clinical expert to understand and identify hazards in their clinical context.</p>
<p>Next, identify which software items could cause hazardous situations [[62304:7.1.1 62304:7.3.3.a]], and list them, along with the forseeably causes [[62304:7.3.3.b]].  Consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>whether requirements are appropriate and are meeting the needs of users</p></li>
<li><p>incorrect or incomplete specifications of functionality [[62304:7.1.2.a]]</p></li>
<li><p>software defects in the software item [[62304:7.1.2.b]]</p></li>
<li><p>failure or unexpected results from SOUP  [[62304:7.1.2.c]]</p></li>
<li><p>how hardware failures or software defects in other items could result in unpredictable operation  [[62304:7.1.2.d]]</p></li>
<li><p>reasonably forseeably misuse by users [[62304:7.1.2.e]]</p></li>
<li><p>the list of causes in Annex B of IEC80002-1:2009 [[62304:5.1.12.a 62304:5.1.12.b]]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Include the sequences of events that could result in the hazardous situation [[62304:7.1.5 ]].
If failure or unexpected results from SOUP is a potential cause contributing to a hazardous situation, review the list of anomalies for the SOUP (if any) for known anomalies relevant to this hazardous situation [[62304:7.1.3]].</p>
<p>Record the identified hazards, causes, hazardous situations, and harms in {{ system.risk_matrix_location }} as an individual risk [[62304:7.1.4 and 62304:9.5]].</p>
<p>Finally, estimate the severity and probability of each risk and record this as well [[14971:4.4]].</p>
<p>See the [appendices](#risk-management) for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Risk assessment</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ensure that the hazard, hazardous situation, and harms recorded for new risks appropriately follow their ISO14971 definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the risk probability is justifiable.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the new risks listed are appropriate, and are not unnecessarily detailed to the point of not contributing to improved safety.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>## Risk Control</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Risk assessment</p>
<p>Evaluate unmitigated risks listed in {{ system.risk_matrix_location }} [[14971:5]].
{# TODO: for now, evaluating risks based on their probability and severity is a manual process.  This should be automated with a tool sometime in the near future #}
{# TODO: incorporate residual risk evaluation [[14971:6.4]] and risk/benefit analysis [[14971:6.5]] #}
If any of the risks require reduction, then identify appropriate risk control measures.  Consider risk control measure options, in the following order:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>inherent safety by design (i.e., refactoring or architecting away the risks, or even removing requirements)</p></li>
<li><p>adding software{% if not system.is_software_only_device %} or hardware{% endif %}</p></li>
<li><p>providing information to the user in the form of documentation or user interface elements—these should be avoided as much as possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Create a change request for the risk control measure [[14971:6.3 62304:7.2.1 62304:7.3.3.c]].</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Risk control related change requests</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ensure that risks controls don’t introduce larger risks than they mitigate [[14971:6.6.a, 14971:6.6.b and 62304:7.3.1, since risk control measures will be implemented as part of this activity]]</p></li>
<li><p>As appropriate, ensure that the inherent safety by design is preferred over adding software or hardware risk control measures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>{# Add activity to ensure completeness of risk control per 14971:6.7 #}</p>
<p>## Division of Labor</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Design files</p>
<p>All work on the software project should occur in response to approved change requests [[62304:8.2.1]]. There are many ways to divide new requirements work into change requests. Change requests associated with requirements which will be implemented soon may be split into smaller change requests, while requirements which may not be worked on for several months can be captured in a single large change request.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Feature change requests</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> Not applicable to this activity</p>
<p>## Release Planning</p>
<p>[[:This activity addresses 62304:6.3.1, since change requests resulting from maintenance and problem resolution are processed in the same manner in which risk control measures and feature change requests. Note that some releases are only meant for tracking development. The first commercial release is typically v1.0.]]

<p><strong>Input:</strong> Feature and problem fix change requests</p>
<p>To organize and prioritize the development work, change requests are assigned to GitHub milestones.  Change requests that have not yet been assigned to a GitHub milestone have not yet been approved, and should not be worked on [[62304:8.2.1, 62304:6.2.4]].</p>
<p>Once a change request is assigned to a milestone, it has been “approved” and may be worked on by a developer.  The project lead will then assign developers to change requests to divide up the work.  Software developers may also assign themselves to change requests, so long as it is not assigned to another developer and they don’t have other outstanding tickets they can work on.</p>
<p>The project lead should coordinate with the business owner regarding which change requests to include in a release.  When planning a release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Consider outstanding problem reports [[62304:9.4]].</p></li>
<li><p>Look through historical problem reports and attempt to identify any adverse trends.  For example, some software items may have many problem reports associated with them [[62304:9.6 and 14971:9.a]]
or may have new or revised standards [[14971:9.b]].</p></li>
<li><p>Review {{ system.risk_matrix_location }} for risk control measures that have not been implemented [[62304:7.3.1 and 62304:7.2.2.c]].</p></li>
<li><p>Review <cite>soup.yml</cite>.  Look for SOUP which has become obsolete, SOUP which should be upgraded, and for known anomalies in published anomalies lists as appropriate [[62304:6.1.f]].  See [the appendices](#SOUP) for additional details.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Create change requests as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> The set of change requests which should be implemented for the next release</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> Not applicable to this activity</p>
<p>{% if system.safety_class == ‘C’ %}</p>
<p>## Detailed Design</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> SDS</p>
<p>Begin a new Git branch, as discussed in the [unit implementation and testing activity](#unit-implementation-and-testing), but before implementing the change request, document a detailed design either within the SDS or as code comments, as appropriate, for each new software item [[62304:5.4.2]].  These detailed designs should be stored as closely as possible to their corresponding source files.  As appropriate, write out function signatures for the essential procedures, functions, classes, and/or modules involved with the change request.</p>
<p>Detailed designs for interfaces between software items and external components (hardware or software) should be included as appropriate [[62304:5.4.3]].</p>
<p>Once you have completed the detailed design, open a pull request and assign the project lead to review the design.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Software item designs</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> Ensure software requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is not more complicated than it needs to be to meet the requirements</p></li>
<li><p>implements system and software requirements [[62304:5.4.4.a]]</p></li>
<li><p>is free from contradiction with the SDS [[62304:5.4.4.b]].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>{% endif %}</p>
<p>## Unit Implementation and Testing</p>
<p>[[:This activity addresses 62304:5.5.1]]</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> {% if system.safety_class == ‘C’ %}Detailed software item designs{% else %}SDS{% endif %} and software requirements</p>
<p>Create a new Git branch with a name that includes the change request number (e.g., <cite>104-short-description</cite>).  Commit your code changes to this branch and push periodically [[62304:5.1.1.d, 62304:6.1.e and 62304:8.2.2]].  Commit messages should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>explain why the current changes are being made, as appropriate</p></li>
<li><p>reference the change request that prompted the changes (the <cite>rdm hooks</cite> command can streamline including these references).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>During development, as appropriate:</p>
<p>{% if system.safety_class != ‘C’ -%}
- Write specifications for new software items in the SDS.
- Update the software architecture diagrams.{% endif %}
- Analyze how this change request effects the entire software system, and consider whether any software items should be refactored or reused [[62304:6.2.3]].
- Consider whether any external systems that the software system interfaces with may be affected [[62304:6.2.3]].
- If software has been released, consider whether any existing data needs to be migrated.
- Write unit tests and new integration tests.
- If SOUP was added, removed, or changed, update the <cite>soup.yaml</cite> file (see the [appendices](#SOUP) for details).
- If the change request includes risk control measures, record the risk control measures in {{ system.risk_matrix_location }} along with the residual risk.  Also add new software requirements for the risk control measure and record the software requirement id along with the risk [[14971:6.2 and 62304:7.2.2.a]].
- Perform the [Risk Assessment](#risk-assessment) [[14971:6.6]] and [Risk Control](#risk-control) Activities on any software items (including SOUP) which were are added or modified [[62304:7.4.1.a]], including new risk control measures[[62304:7.4.1.b, since they may have introduced new risks [[62304:6.1.c, 62304:7.4 62304:7.3.1, 62304:7.4.3 since risk control measures will be implemented as part of this activity]] or impact on existing risk control measures [[62304:7.4.2]].</p>
<p>When work on a change branch is nearing completion, a pull request should be created for this branch.  A brief summary of the changes should be included in the pull request description.  These comments will be included in the final release history.  The description should also mention whether risk assessments were performed, or why not, and if tests were not required, why not.</p>

<p>The developer performing the review should create a GitHub review and record their notes there.  If any changes are requested, address them and re-submit the review once they have been addressed.  The reviewer must approve the pull request from within the GitHub user interface [[62304:8.2.4.c]].  We suggest using the following format for your reviews:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`</span>

<p>This detailed checklist is not necessary for small changes or for changes early during the project.</p>
<p>Where the <cite>x</cite> indicates that the item was completed.</p>
<p>GitHub [saved replies](<a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-saved-replies">https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-saved-replies</a>) can help facilitate this process.</p>
<p>If, as is occasionally appropriate, someone outside of the core development team reviews a pull request, then mention who performed the review in the pull request body and tag the pull request with the <cite>external-review</cite> label.</p>
<p>{%- if system.safety_class != ‘C’ %}
Occasionally, due to the absence of other reviewers or due to an internal testing deadline, it may be necessary to skip verification.  When this occurs, the developer should justify why a review wasn’t necessary within the pull request comments.

<p>## Integration</p>
<p>{# TODO: address traceability from software items to software system tests; see 62304:5.1.1.c #}</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Unmerged, but approved, pull-request</p>
<p>Merge the approved Git branch into the <cite>master</cite> Git branch, correct any merge conflicts that occur.  Once the branch has been merged successfully, delete the branch in GitHub [[62304:5.1.5 and 62304:5.6.1]].</p>

<p><strong>Verification:</strong> Not applicable to this activity</p>
<p>## Integration and System Testing</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Software system built using the changes from this release’s change requests</p>
<p>The final integration prior to a release must formally record the test output in a test record.  The test record must include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The list of tests that passed or failed [[62304:5.6.7.a 62304:5.7.5.a]]</p></li>
<li><p>Verification that the results meet the pass/fail criteria listed in the Test Plan [[62304:5.7.4.c 62304:5.6.7.a]]</p></li>
<li><p>The version of the software being tested (e.g., the Git commit hash) [[62304:5.6.7.b 62304:5.7.5.b]]</p></li>
<li><p>The name of the person who ran the tests [[62304:5.6.6, 62304:5.6.7, 62304:5.7.5.c, 62304:5.6.7.c and 62304:9.8]].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any test failures found during the formal release system testing shall be recorded as problem reports [[62304:5.6.8 62304:5.7.4.d]].  See the [prepare problem report activity](#prepare-problem-report) for details [[62304:5.7.2]].  If any change requests are implemented in response to these problem reports, the tests must be re-run [[62304:5.7.3.a 62304:5.7.3.b]].  If it is deemed unnecessary to re-run some of the tests, the justification as to why shall be included in the test record [[62304:5.7.3.c note that the risk management activities for (c) will be handled as part of the unit implementation and testing activity]].</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Test record and problem reports
[[62304:5.6.3, 62304:5.6.4, and 62304:7.3.3.d]]

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the original problem is fixed and the problem report closed [[62304:9.7.a]]</p></li>
<li><p>any adverse trends have been reversed [[62304:9.7.b]].</p></li>

<p>## Release</p>
<p>[[:This activity addresses 62304:6.3.2, since development releases and maintenance releases are treated equivalently]]</p>
<p>TODO: Write out how to archive the software system release.  This will vary from project to project.  Here are some exmples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the output of the build process is a binary, then the binary should be saved somewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>If the output is a set of Python scripts with out any SOUP, then the source code within the Git repository is already sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>If the output is a set of Python scripts with Python dependencies, then copies of the Python dependencies must be archived somewhere.  Likewise, if there are other system dependencies, like postgres, then the debian package files (or perhaps a virtual box image) need to be archived.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>ENDTODO</p>
<p>The purpose of the archive is to provide a means to re-test problems which may occur in an old version of the software.</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Implemented and verified change requests for the current milestone</p>
<p>When a new version of the software is released, the Git commit corresponding to the state of the code should be [tagged](<a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging</a>) with the version number.</p>
<p>Archived releases shall be kept until indefinitely.</p>

<p>## Requirements Analysis</p>
<p>Writing software requirements is an art and a science; one must find balance between precision and usefulness.
{% if not system.is_software_only_device %}
The distinction between system requirements and software requirements can be challenging.  System requirements describe the requirements of the entire system, including software and hardware.  Software requirements must be traceable to all of the system requirements that they help fulfill.  Software requirements are usually more detailed than the system requirements they refer to.  Many system requirements will be fulfilled using both hardware and software.
{% endif %}
The distinction between software requirements and the specifications is {% if not system.is_software_only_device %}also {% endif %}typically challenging.  Requirements should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>not imply solution</p></li>
<li><p>be verifiable</p></li>
<li><p>be short, ideally one or two sentences long.</p></li>

<p>## Risk Management</p>
<p>This subsection provides a brief introduction to risk management in the context of software development.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong> is freedom from unacceptable risk.  Note that it does not mean that there is no risk, as that is impossible.  The perception of risk can depend greatly on cultural, socio-economic and educational background, the actual and perceived state of health of the patient, as well as whether the hazard was avoidable.</p>
<p>Our obligation as medical device software developers is to develop safe devices, while balancing economic constraints—a device that is never made can not help patients, so there may be risk associated with not bringing a device to market if the device meets a clinical problem.</p>
<p><strong>Risk</strong> is the combination of the probability of harm and the severity of that harm.</p>
<p><strong>Harm</strong> is physical injury or damage of health of people (patients or users), or damage to property or the environment.</p>
<p>A <strong>hazard</strong> is a potential source of harm.</p>
<p>A <strong>hazardous situation</strong> is a circumstance in which people, property, or the environment is exposed to one or more hazard(s).  Not every hazardous situation leads to harm.</p>
<p>Software is not itself a hazard because it can not directly cause harm, but software can contribute towards producing hazardous situations.</p>

<p>{# TODO: add guidance on risk estimation #}</p>
<p>{# TODO: discuss probabilities of software events #}</p>
<p>{# TODO: add details about the <cite>risk.yml</cite> file format #}</p>
<p>## SOUP</p>
<p>Information in the <cite>soup.yaml</cite> file may duplicate information found in other files (e.g., <cite>requirements.txt</cite> or <cite>package.json</cite>).</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially when working on software items with low levels of concern, it can be appropriate to lump a few SOUP packages into a single item within the <cite>soup.yml</cite> file.</p>
<p>The <cite>soup.yaml</cite> should contain a sequence of mappings, each containing the keys in parenthesis below.  Some keys are optional.  All values must be strings.</p>
<p>The header of each sub-section contains the <cite>title</cite> of the SOUP [[62304:8.1.2.a]].</p>
<p>The <cite>manufacturer</cite> is the name of the company that developed the SOUP.  If the manufacturer field is absent, then this SOUP was developed collaboratively by the free open-source software community, and does not have a manufacturer in the traditional sense [[62304:8.1.2.b]].</p>
<p>The <cite>version</cite> of each SOUP is a unique identifier, which specifies the version of the SOUP which is used in the software [[62304:8.1.2.c]].  The version may follow varying formats, such as <cite>1.0.13</cite>, <cite>1.2r5</cite>, or even <cite>2021-05-05</cite>, as appropriate.</p>
<p>{%- if system.safety_class != “A” %}
The <cite>purpose</cite> of each SOUP describes the functional and performance requirements that are necessary for its intended use [[62304:5.3.3]].</p>
<p>The <cite>requirements</cite> will be present if there are any noteworthy hardware and software requirements for the SOUP to function properly within the system [[62304:5.3.4]].</p>
<p>The known <cite>anomalies</cite> present in the SOUP which may affect the functioning of {{ system.project_name }} should be recorded, as should the <cite>anomaly_reference</cite>, a location of the published anomalies list [[62304:7.1.3]].</p>
<p>When reviewing open anomalies:
- Follow a risk based approach; concentrate on high priority anomalies (assuming the SOUP manufacturer provides such a categorization).
- If the list of known anomalies is large (e.g., more than 100), without prioritization, then sample the list as appropriate for the risk associated with the SOUP.
- When possible, focus the review on anomalies which affect portions of SOUP which are used by {{ system.project_name }}.
