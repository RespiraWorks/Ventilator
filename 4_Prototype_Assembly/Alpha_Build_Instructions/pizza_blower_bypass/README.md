# Blower Bypass

The blower bypass is an optional "topping" that can be integrated into the [pizza build](../../Alpha_Build_Instructions/pizza_build.md).

The purpose of the blower bypass is to prevent strain on blower when the inhale pinch valve is closed. Note the alternative parts for 3/8"ID and 3/4"ID builds.
