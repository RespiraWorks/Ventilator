===================

This document defines the system requirements for |PROJECT_NAME|.

.. _RW-SYS-003:

RW-SYS-003
----------
The system shall control the target peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) from 5-55 cmH2O in increments of 1 cm H2O.
The system shall measure and numerically display patient pressure in the range of 0 - 60 cmH2O with resolution 1 cmH2O.
The system shall display the measured pressure as a graph with duration of 30 seconds updated at a rate >= 20Hz and units of cmH2O.

Children: :ref:`RW-SW-002`

.. _RW-SYS-005:

RW-SYS-005
----------
The system shall control the target PEEP from 0 - 20 cm H2O in increments of 1 cmH2O.
The system shall measure and numerically display the PEEP in the range of 0 - 20 cmH2O in increments of 1 cmH2O.
