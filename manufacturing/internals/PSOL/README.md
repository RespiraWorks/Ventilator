## Assembly

**Note: Please see general advice in the [manufacturing methods guide](../../methods).**

Note that mounting the Uflow solenoid may require tapping of M3 threads in the aluminium manifold.

**ATTENTION: tools for tapping not listed here.**

Mounts to acrylic with 2x:
* M3x10 screws
* M3 washers 9mm OD
