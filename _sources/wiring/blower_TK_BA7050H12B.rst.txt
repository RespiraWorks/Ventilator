   * Solder
* Instructions:
   #. Cut 3 pieces of the 5mm heat shrink, 15mm long each.
   #. Thread the 5mm heat shrink onto the the entire bundle of 4 wires on the blower.  Do not shrink the heat shrink yet.
   #. Insert the 2x pre-crimped Mega-Fit wires into the Megafit 2x2 housing.
   #. Do a gentle pull test to confirm proper seating of the contacts.
   #. Cut the cable at a length of 50mm from the connector.
   #. Strip 5mm of insulation from the end of the pre-crimped wires and from the ends of the red and black pigtails of the blower.
   #. Cut 2 pieces of 3mm heat shrink, 15mm long.
   #. Take the 2 pieces of heat shrink and slide one each onto the red and black wires of the blower.
   #. Solder the red and black wires to the Mega-Fit connector cables according to the diagram (pin 1 on the Mega-Fit connector is indicated by a stripe on the connector body).
   #. Slide the heat shrink over the soldered portion and use the heat gun to shrink them in place.
   #. Strip the insulation from the blue pigtail of the blower, using the Micro-Fit crimp contact as a guide for the legth of insulation to strip.
   #. Using the micro-fit crimper, crimp the contact onto the end of the blue wire.
   #. Insert the contact and wire into the micro-fit connector housing according to the diagram.
   #. Do a gentle pull test to confirm proper seating of the contacts.
   #. On the yellow blower wire, cut off any uninsulated portion from the end of the wire and place a 5mm long piece of 3mm heat shrink tubing on the end and heat shrink it in place.
   #. Distribute the 5mm heat shrink tubing evenly along the harness bundle and shrink them with the heat gun.
