* Instructions:
   #. Cut a 300mm length of blue and white wire.
   #. Strip the desired length of insulation from each end of each wire.
   #. Crimp the Micro-Fit contacts to one end, and the KK contacts to the other on each wire.
   #. Cut 3 pieces, 15mm long each, of heat shrink tubing, and thread them onto the set of two wire.  Do not shrink the heat shrink yet.  Make sure to keep the simlar types of contacts on the same side.
