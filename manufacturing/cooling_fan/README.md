## Design rationale

Computing electronics and stepper motors generate heat. This heat may accumulate in a closed space. Excess heat
can negatively impact the performance of computer processors and may also pose a fire hazard. A cooling fan
is required to drive hot air out of the enclosure.

**WARNING:** This sub-assembly is current **not functional**.

The first version of the mainboard did not have any provisions for powering and controlling a cooling fan.
Thus, installing one in the current design is simply a proof of concept for the mechanical/manufacturing
design.

Some questions yet to be systematically addressed:
* noise levels
* component lifetime
* air outflow vent
* airflow across the most heat-prone components

## Assembly

**Note: Please see general advice in the [manufacturing methods guide](../methods).**

Currently, the fan must be mounted after the internal assembly is already in the enclosure. Because of the
shape of the enclosure, it has been found that the equipment tray must be inserted at an angle. If the cooling
fan were already in place in the enclosure, it would probably interfere with this installation step.
