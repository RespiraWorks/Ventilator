# Pizza Build

**DISCLAIMER: These are live documents.
There are duplicate and alternative items for undecided aspects of the physical design. 
RespiraWorks may or may not compensate you for any of these parts if you choose to buy them. Please connect with Edwin or Ethan first.
If you decide to buy them, do so at your own risk... oh, and thank you ;).**

This build consists of a functional ventilator pneumatic assembly with controller and user interface. This build is adequate for integration and systems testing.

Note: the sensing tube diagram above is not correct, please refer the the drawing below for how to connect the venturis pressure sensors on the PCB, and mind which tubes go into the bottom and top port of the sensors on the PCB.

It lacks heating, oxygen mixing, humidification, battery backup and air filtering.
It is also not enclosed like the final product and is meant to be operated in an open layout on your table, like a pizza.

**This is not intended to be used on patients and lacks a number of safety features.**

This build depends on already having a Brain build, which has its own BOM [here](brain_build.md).

## Pizza Toppings

**Optional additions (toppings) for your pizza build:**
These can be added or customized based on what functions you need to test in your pizza build.
* **Reduced compliance test lung:** To test basic function a ventilator check lung or a breathing bag is sufficient, but can really only work up to 10cmH2O. To be able to test higher PIP values, you need to reduce the compliance of the lung so you donâ€™t just inflate it like a balloon (or pop it). View more details on reduced compliance test lung [here](reduced_compliance_test_lung.md).
