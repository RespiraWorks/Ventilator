# Beta Build Instructions

This page contains a running list of notes that will be organized and added to as we get further into beta design and build. 

## Venturi updates

The plan is for beta to use 3/4"ID tubing throughout. The venturi will most likely be redesigned to have barbs that fit 3/4"ID tubing directly.
