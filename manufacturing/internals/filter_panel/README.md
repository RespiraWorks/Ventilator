## Overview

The filter panel accommodates four [filter housing assemblies](filter_holder) - two with patient tubing adapters,
and two without. The filter housings are installed on a clear acrylic sheet. In case of different filters being
available and/or required in particular markets or settings, this assembly can be easily redesigned and
swapped out without significantly altering the rest of the ventilator design.
