# Venturi flow sensor

![Rendering](screenshot.png)

The venturi is used to measure flow by measuring a change in pressure.
This version inserts within 5/8" ID tubing, though can also be used with 16mm ID tubing. 
You can use a zip tie or hose clamp to improve the seal. 

The plan is for [beta](/../../4_Manufacturing_Design/Beta_Build_Instructions/README.md) to use 3/4"ID tubing throughout. The venturi will most likely be redesigned to have barbs that fit 3/4"ID tubing directly.

The flow sensor we are using has 2.5 mm or 3/32" barbs, which is too small for 1/8" tubing, therefore this model has #10-32 tapped holes.

There is an arrow printed onto the body to indicate the direction of flow.

## Transfer function

To go from voltage to flow rate, you need the following transfer functions.
For a 0.157" throat and 0.5" body using a 0-3920 Pa analog sensor, where offset is the 0 flow signal:

Q [liters/minute] = 0.75398*sqrt(1346.584669*(voltage-offset))
**TODO:** make math pretty with Mathjax?

For an arbitrary body geometry, you can use the following short spreadsheet to return the transfer function:

## Pressure Sensor

This venturi is designed to be paired with this sensor and a 14-bit ADC.

Adjust values in the spreadsheet above accordingly to see how it will perform in your setup.

## Assembly

![Nipples](venturi-nipples.jpg)

Screw the nipples into the 3d-printed venturi. There are threads in the print but they donâ€™t always come out right if resin get a trapped in the grooves while it prints,
 so you might a tap (listed in tooling BOM above) to clean the threads. You do not need a bottoming tap, there is enough depth in the holes and the threads are short.
In the latest version, however, no hand-tapping was required to insert nipples. With good enough 3d priting, this step should not be necessary. 

**Testing:**
Check for leaks by plugging the holes and pulling some vacuum. 
* Plug one large end, plug both nipples, suck on the remaining end.  If you have a vacuum pump handy do a regular vacuum hold leak test
* Or, blow into each port with your fingers over the other three.
