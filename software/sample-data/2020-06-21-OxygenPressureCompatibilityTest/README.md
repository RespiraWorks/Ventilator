# 2020-06-21 Oxygen Pressure Compatibility Test

- In this test we demonstrate the capability of the ventilator to run at differnt source pressures.
- The ventilator is fed by a charged compressed air tank at around 110psi.  As the ventilator draws down the tank, the source pressure drops, and the ventilator is recorded operating normally until about 20psi.
- CoVent test line 6 was used for this test.
