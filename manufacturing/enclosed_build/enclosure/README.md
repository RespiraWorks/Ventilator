The ventilator enclosure is made up of three folded, 1.52mm thick, stainless steel sheets; the main enclosure, the rear
closure panel and the internal equipment bracket.

The main enclosure is folded from a single sheet and fastened together using stainless steel blind rivets. There
are rubber bumper feet on the bottom of the enclosure that are threaded into M6 press-fit nuts. The rubber bumpers
can be removed to allow the enclosure to be mounted to a medical cart.

The rear closure panel is folded from a single sheet.

The internal equipment bracket is folded from a single sheet. The bracket is designed to be simple and lightweight.
Acrylic sheets are either fastened to or hung from the bracket to allow for design adjustments while utilizing the same
bracket.

**#TODO: present CAD information properly, in a structured, attractive way**

The part files are available in the CAD folder. [.ipt for enclosure](CAD/ventilator_enclosure.ipt),
[.ipt for equipment bracket](CAD/equipment_bracket.ipt), [.ipt for closure panel](CAD/ventilator_closure_panel.ipt).
The assembly file is also available [.iam for enclosure assembly](CAD/enclosure_assembly.iam).
