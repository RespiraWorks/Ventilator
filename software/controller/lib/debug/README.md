# Debug serial interface

This library adds a simple serial interface primarily intended to be used
for system debugging.  This entire library can be compiled out of the
production system. **#TODO** How?

The interface can be accessed via a python script located at
[software/utils/controller_debug.py](../../../utils/controller_debug.py)

There is also a [brief tutorial](../../../utils/controller_debug.md) on how to use it.
