// When we use DMA, a transfer is performed directly in hardware and the end
// of transfer triggers a DMA interrupt which we use to start the next
// transfer. Note that a current limitation is that DMA cannot be used for
// transfers that are longer than 255 bytes AND include a functional header
// within their data because our implementation doesn't support reload mode
// with DMA.
//
// When we don't, we listen to the I²C interrupts to know when to read/write
// the next byte in a transfer, and when a transfer is complete.
//
// We don't necessarily plan to use the second mode in production, but it
// should come in handy during integration testing, when we want to closely
// monitor what is sent on the bus.
