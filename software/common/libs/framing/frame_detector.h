/**
 * FrameDetector detects frames of this format:
 * ...MbbbbbbbbbbbM...
 * Where M is frame MARK byte and b is any other byte. It is responsibility of sender to ensure that
 * MARK characters appear in the incoming stream to only mark the start and the end of the frame.
 *
 * Correct stream of frames will look like this:
 * ...MbbbbbbMMbbbbbbbbMMbbbbbbbbbMMbbbbbM...
 *
 * RxBuffer is responsible for underlying reception and buffering of incoming data. Also RxBuffer
 * provides callbacks described by RxListener interface. In particular:
 *
 *   on_character_match is called when MARK character is received
 *   on_rx_complete is called when the requested number of bytes was received
 *   on_rx_error is called when an error occurs in the underlying reception infrastructure
 *
 * FrameDetector is modeled as a Finite State Machine having states:
 *
 *   Lost - FrameDetector is lost in the stream of incoming bytes and will interpret the next MARK
 *          byte as an end of the frame.
 *   WaitForStartMarker - FrameDetector is synced and is waiting for MARK byte that will denote the
 *          start of the frame
 *   ReceivingFrame - FrameDetector is synced and will interpret the next MARK byte as an end of the
 *          frame and will interpret the bytes in RxBuffer as a frame.
 *
 * on_rx_error will cause FrameDetector to transition to the Lost state, frame being received will
 *      be ignored:
 *          ...MbbbbbbEbbbbMMbbbbbbbM
 *             ^-----------^ this frame will be ignored
 *                          ^-------^ this frame will be received
 *
 * on_rx_complete should not happen in normal reception. When FrameEncoder orders a reception from
 *      RxBuffer, it specifies maximum length of the frame expected, also FrameEncoder restarts
 *      reception upon receiving OnCharMatch callback. Thus, receiving OnRxComplete callback means
 *      that we get no MARK characters in the stream because sender is sending garbage or a frame
 *      that is longer than the expected length.
 *
 * FrameDetector keeps a copy of the last successfully received frame and a flag denoting if the
 * last received frame was read by the caller.
