Frost Methane Labs COVID-19 Ventilator Project (ACSPEED test software)

This is basic hardware bringup testing and demo software for a COVID-19/ARDS Ventilator

  Objective is to make a minimum-viable ARDS ventilator that can be deployed 
  or constructed on-site in countries underserved by commecial global supply 
  chains during the COVID-19 outbreak.
  
  Currently consists of a (1) CPAP-style blower with speed control.
  
  (2)Feedback from a differential pressure sensor with one side
  measuring delivered pressure to patient, other side ambient.
  
  Tested on an RF-nano arduino board, which has similar parts and pinout to an
  Arduino Nano.
