# Alpha BOM

Here we have parts lists for various levels of the alpha build.

**DISCLAIMER: These are live documents.
There are duplicate and alternative items for undecided aspects of the physical design. 
RespiraWorks may, or may not compensate you for any of these parts.
If you decide to buy them, do so at your own risk.**

[Brain build](brain-build.md) constitutes just the compute components.

[Pizza build](pizza-build.md) is an upgrade that includes sensors, drivers and pneumatics.

These are living documents and will keep changing. Check back often.
