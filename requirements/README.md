# Requirements

-------------

# Overview

Requirements are still being granularly defined and documented. We use Valispace software for requirements tracking; an export is updated here ~weekly.

* [PDF format](system-reqs.pdf)
* [XLSX format](system-reqs.xlsx)
* **#TODO:** To be actually open source, put exported json in this directory and link nicely from here.


# Using Valispace

*Check the #requirements slack pinned posts for the password, or contact us at info@respira.works for access. We will eventually be uploading JSON's of the entire database.*

Note that you can use the "position" value to move requirements around and change the display order in Valispace.
