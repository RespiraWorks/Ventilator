# FixMoreLungs

COVID-19 Ventilator Software (ACSPEED test) software developed by Frost
Methane Labs.

This is basic hardware bringup testing and demo software for a COVID-19/ARDS Ventilator

## Objective

To make a minimum-viable ARDS ventilator that can be deployed
or constructed on-site in countries underserved by commercial global supply
chains during the COVID-19 outbreak.

## Overview

Currently consists of a:
1. CPAP-style blower with speed control.
2. Feedback from a differential pressure sensor with one side measuring delivered pressure to patient, other side ambient.

## Setup

Tested with an RF-nano arduino board, which has similar parts and pinout to an
Arduino Nano.

Using the Arduino IDE, you will also need to install the PID library from
[here](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library). Steps for Arduino library
installation instructions can be found
[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries)
