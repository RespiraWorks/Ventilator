* Using items from above BOM as well as:
   * 5mm heat shrink tubing [:ref:`ew-shrink5`]
* Instructions:
   #. Insert the 4 pre-crimped cables :ref:`[2] <ew-pre2>` into the 2x2 Mega-Fit housing :ref:`[6] <ec-mega4>`.
   #. Clip the crimped ends off the remaining free end of the cables.
   #. Slide 15mm of heat shrink onto each of the 2 cables that will go to the DIN receptacle.
   #. Slide on a few extra lengths of heat shrink tubing for cable management before you proceed.
   #. Solder the cables to the DIN receptacle :ref:`[3] <ec-dinf4>` per the cable drawing.  Apply the heat shrink to the junction.
   #. Crimp the QC terminals :ref:`[4] <ec-qctf>` per the drawing.
   #. Crimp the ring terminal :ref:`[5] <ec-ring>` per the drawing.
   #. Do a gentle pull test to confirm proper seating of all the contacts.
   #. Shrink the remaining pieces of heat shrink to make the cable more manageable.
