# 2021-01-24 CA Enclosed Vent Baseline Test - OXY

* **Date of test:** 2021-01-24

* **Tester:** Edwin Chiu edwin@respira.works

* **Software version**: [ba9d365](https://github.com/RespiraWorks/Ventilator/commit/ba9d36569508827b770cb7a36474aeba5220151e)

* **Test data:** /RespiraWorks/Ventilator/tree/master/software/sample-data/2021-01-24-CaEnclosedVent-Baseline-AIR

* **Summary Observations:**
  * There is a lot of chatter in both the air and oxygen check valves
  * As expected, the dynamics of the enclosed ventilator are different than those of the pizza build and there is some oscillation in the control.

* **Summarize test setup's main components:**
  * This the first test of the Enclosed Ventilator build in California, using unmodified and untuned pizzabuild software
  * The main objective of this test is to establish baseline of perfromance before pursuing any changes or tuning.
  * Oxygen PSOL is UFlow IBV19M
  * Blower is WS7040
  * Oxygen Regulator IR2010-N02B
  * 4x filters are present: Inhale, Exhale, and both patient isolation filters.
  * Compressed air from a compressor tank is used as a stand-in for oxygen.
  * The source pressure is set to approx. 50psi
  * The ventilator internal regulator pressure is set to approx. 35psi
