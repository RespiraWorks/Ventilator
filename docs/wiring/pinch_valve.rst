* Using items from above BOM as well as:
   * 5mm heat shrink tubing [:ref:`ew-shrink5`]
   * Heat gun
   * Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 Crimper [:ref:`te-microfit-crimper`]
   * Wire Strippers

* Instructions:
   #. In this procedure all we need to do is heat shrink the pinch valve's wires for cleanliness and apply a connector to the pigtail wires.
   #. Cut 3 pieces of the 5mm heat shrink tubing, each 5mm long, and place them over all 4 wires.
   #. Distribute the heat shrink pieces evenly along the wires' length and heat shrink them in place.
   #. Strip the appropriate length of insulation from each wire for Micro-Fit 3.0 crimp contacts.
   #. Crimp the Micro-Fit contacts to the end of each one.
   #. Insert each contact into the Micro-Fit connector housing, according to the wiring diagram.  Pin 1 is indicated by a raised stripe molded into the connector housing.
   #. Do a gentle pull test to confirm proper seating of the contacts.
