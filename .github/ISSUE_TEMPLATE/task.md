Please take the time to describe the problem in detail, so that other contributors can pick it up and implement or declare it done/obsolete in case if was completed out of band.

**When to create Feature request or Task?**

Feature request is like a User Story. Task represents work that needs to be done. (Sub-)task would be underneath a Feature request (Story) which in our case (R&D) might just stand in the way.

Task can include non-code and most likely will i.e. study/investigate X , do a PoC of Y (pseudo-code?) , get more info about something (+writing a documentation is a task)

**What has to be done**
Describe what has to be done, ideally in declarative form - what does success look like.

**How do you know it has to be done**
Link any documents, Slack threads, quote personal communication, reference your personal domain expertise etc. explaining why you think this should be done.

**Code pointers**
Give some thoughts on roughly where in code do you think the necessary changes might be located.

**Don't forget**
- [ ] Put the issue in a milestone
- [ ] Assign it to one of the projects
- [ ] Add appropriate labels
- [ ] Mention dependent/blocked issues if any
