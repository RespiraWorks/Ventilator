# 2020-06-17 Master CoVent Tests on QuickLung

- Test Hardware: Pizza board SN 01 (Edwin) with bowed inhale pinch valve replaced
- PID Gains: unchanged
- Exhale Valve Settings: unchanged
- Pinch Valve Lineatization: unchanged
- Test #8 calls for R10 but this is not a QuickLung setting, so R20 was used.
- Notes: Pinch valve replacement helped overshoot issues, but overshoot is still an issue
