This file is meant to document the rationales for the design decisions we're making - or things we considered and rejected.

Caution: this document has not been formally reviewed and is a work in progress. Be responsible to 
understand the provenance of documentation.

Also note: right now we are collecting initial information here since it is easier - we may split 
this up to have the different sections live with the different component folders, but we'll figure that out later.

Guiding princples for the effort:
1. Low cost but robust - want to create something that is affordable, but also that can perform the necessary
duties reliably with high confidence over extended periods of time

2. Keep It Simple (Stupid) - remove complexity wherever possible to reduce failure modes (and cost), without sacrificing key functionality
(though certain functionality may not be achieved)

Tubing
1. Pick peristaltic tubing so that it can withstand many cycles
