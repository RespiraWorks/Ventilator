## Guidelines

**TODO:** How should our hierarchy of reqs look like - eg. when do you need a separate spec vs a separate section vs tag?

**TODO:** ID naming scheme?

**TODO:** what else?

## Tips

**Search by tag** Select the node of your search scope on the left (eg. `All requirements`), enter the tag in the search
field at the top (eg. `beta`), press enter.

**Bulk edit** You can't. But to avoid clicking through requirements one by one, you can display the column you want to
edit, and edit it inline. Press "..." at the rightmost column, Visible columns, select the one you need.

**Filter** You can filter by any column. Hover on the column header and press the filter icon.

**Reordering** Use the "position" value to move requirements around and change the display order in Valispace.
