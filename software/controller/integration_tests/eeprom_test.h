// Summary:
//      This test reads the initial state of the EEPROM, writes length bytes
//      (all equal to data) at the provided address in the EEPROM, only to read
//      them again and compare what was written to what was read.
//      It then restores the EEPROM to its initial state after it ran, unless
//      the test failed because of a hardware fault.
//
//      The PCB buzzer starts during the EEPROM access and stops after about 1s
//      if the test succeeds. This means it will keep buzzing if the test fails.
//
// How to run:
//      deploy_test.sh <device_id> eeprom <address> <data> <length>
//      The sum of address and length cannot exceed 32768 because of EEPROM
//      size.
//      length cannot exceed I2C write buffer size - 6 bytes (i.e. 4090).
//      data has to be in the [0 ; 255] range (it is written as bytes).
//
//      example: deploy_test.sh eeprom p7 eeprom 0 42 1000
//          Reads the first 1000 bytes of the EEPROM, replaces them with 42 on
//          the EEPROM, then reads them again, and checks that the second read
//          is equal to what was written.
//          It then writes the first 1000 bytes it initially read back to the
//          EEPROM to put it back in its initial state.
//
//      In case the buzzer doesn't work, or you are working on a remote machine
//      with no way to hear sound, you can check the result manually using the
//      debug interface:
//      $ utils/controller_debug.py
//      ] get result
//      Will return 1 if the result is successful, and 0 otherwise.
//
//      In case of failure, the debug interface provides a way to manually check
//      all steps of the process by reading the actual data that is contained in
//      the eeprom_before, write_data and eeprom_after tables, through a
//      combination of get and peek commands:
//      ] get eeprom_after
//      123456788
//      ] peek 123456788 8
//      0x075BCD14 0x04030201 0x08070605
//      In this example, 123456788 (equal to 0x075BCD14) is the address of the
//      eeprom_after table in the STM32 internal memory, 0x04030201 0x08070605
//      are the contents of this table (which should have been all copies of the
//      same "data" byte, but here contain their address + 1 instead).
//
// Automation:
//      TBD - which python script to run?
