This is the repository for the venturi. 
The venturi is used to measure flow by measuring a change in pressure.
This version inserts within 5/8" ID tubing, though can also be used with 16mm ID tubing. 
The flow sensor we are using has 2.5 mm or 3/32" barbs, which is too small for 1/8" tubing, therefore this model has #10-32 tapped holes for this mcmaster part.

You will also need a 10-32 tap to clean the threads. You do not need a bottoming tap, there is enough depth in the holes and the threads are short.
There is an arrow printed onto the body to indicate the direction of flow.
